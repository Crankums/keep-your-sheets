Sinatra Portfolio Project for Flatiron School


Note: This does NOT perform any action in your game for you! This is simply a place to keep track of your character stats and make modifications as your game progresses. That is why there is no dice rolling utility or RNGs built in to perform any actions for you. Values are changeable, so you're given the ability to do so without limit. It is between you, your party, and your DM to deal with if you make changes to your character or their stats that are not dictated by game rules or circumstances.

Creation notes: need to create HP attribute (add it to Stats_table) and Item MVC (which will have its own programmatic arena, but no way to actually call its views, as it's actually part of Stats)
